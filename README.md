# `etcc`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/topicai/etcc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/topicai/etcc)

The official etcd Go client library is far from easy-to-use. I had to
read `github.com/coreos/etcd/client` and
`github.com/coreos/etcd/etcdctl` before I can write this higher-level
abstraction of etcd client.
